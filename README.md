TourneyManager
==============

This is a C# program designed to manage and run tournaments in real time. TourneyManager currently has small 
goals that will expand as functionality is added. Please refer to the most recent version of this file for
added goals and current milestones.

TourneyManager aims to be applicable to any number of sporting events and will aim to have a open and user-
defined functionality as its final goal. At present, the current goal is to provide implementation of 
tournament management for the sport of fencing. Other sports will be added as components are locked in.

Currently implemented:
Nothing, still in initial build phase

Current milestones for Version 0.1
Manage roster of fencers.
Build rounds for each phase of a pool to DE structured tournament.
Store results of matches and the final results of the tournament.
